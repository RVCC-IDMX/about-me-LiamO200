                <h3>CSS Animation, A Brief History</h3>
                <p>CSS Animation is a way for developers to animate elements of their HTML documents and spring them to
                    life. When it was introduced in CSS3 in 2009 though, it wasn’t beloved by all. Many people believe
                    CSS Animation lacks the flexibility and functionality of Js Animation which is powered by
                    javascript. CSS Animation is able to modify the beginning and end states of an object, whilst Js
                    Animation lets you get in between awarding the user more creative freedoms. This wasn’t it’s only
                    controversy however, many believe it’s existence at all was an elaborate by apple to sidestep adobe
                    flash. Flash was the predominant method of animation for the web for the longest time, but Apple
                    wouldn’t let it function on IOS. IOS is one of the main ways people access the internet now, and
                    it’s rising tide spelled out sure destruction for Adobe seeing as Steve Jobs himself slandered the
                    company and their product by saying flash saps battery power, and it’s the #1 reason why mac
                    products crash. They framed flash as being a “relic of the past”, and openly welcomed CSS Animation
                    to function on safari. Adobe retorted refuting their claims saying it was a “smokescreen”. Jobs
                    acknowledged their strained and drifting relationship saying that although adobe claims their
                    rejection of flash was because of their restrictive and exclusionary business tactics, it’s the
                    opposite and they’re guilty of exactly what they’re accusing. Being beholden to the whims of another
                    third party company is indeed a risky endeavor. CSS animation isn’t reliant on the licenses and
                    random decisions of adobe, which many may cite as the reason why it could be perceived it prevailed.
                    In 2020 flash was discontinued, leaving a great sea of the internet a barren wasteland of errors.
                    The reality is, these complicated stories of endless development wars seem to have no end. Before Js
                    Animation there was Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language or SMIL which users utilized to
                    animate elements. Every iteration in the world will be phased out by its successor whether we like
                    it or not, and with the current trajectory of the internet the only power we have is to hope and
                    pray whatever is next can be translated and archived properly to function on whatever is next. With
                    the plethora of services flash provided, websites utilizing it either had to uproot their entire
                    frameworks with programs to adapt their existing code, or scrap what they had entirely. This is
                    something CSS Animation is less vulnerable to, but will inevitably one day fall victim to. Once the
                    world is hooked up through eyeball projector monitor holograms sending data through neural link
                    brain chips, CSS Animation will be a whisper in the wind spoken only by those who remember a day
                    where little images squished and squashed happily along webpages, a simpler age. Here’s an example
                    of CSS Animation right now! I’ve placed a little cat here for you to enjoy, before the netlify
                    servers pitter out into the ethos with it’s bits and bytes dissipating and drifting through
                    cyberspace, holding fractured memories of what once were 1s and 0s that played the very animation
                    you were looking at now. Past then when we are both long gone, only nomad vagabonds who traverse a
                    barren wasteland will access my hard drive with the smallest bits of recoverable memory will be able
                    to piece it together past the thousands of flash animations i’ve downloaded and wrote it over with.
                    Many may believe this endless crawl of time, every iteration replacing another is a sad nihilistic
                    view of the world. But travel to the quietest mountaintops, and Buddhist monks will enlighten you
                    that the law of impermanence is a beautiful thing. When the inevitable heat death of the universe
                    envelops the final atom of the last brain in a jar containing the final computer programmer to ever
                    remember CSS animation, it will finally be at peace. This little bouncing cat will reincarnate into
                    something beyond our mortal comprehension, and the circle of its very life conceptually will travel
                    again.</p>

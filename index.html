            <h2>Bram Stoker's Dracula</h2>

                <p>There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will now come on to Bukovina, and
                    return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day." Whilst he was speaking the horses began to
                    neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then, amongst a chorus of
                    screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove
                    up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps, as
                    the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a

                <p>That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me, my friend; I
                    know too much, and my horses are swift." As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a
                    hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my

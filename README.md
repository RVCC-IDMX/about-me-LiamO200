The About Me Project

  Hi I’m Liam O’Reilly and this is my About Me web page project. This project at least for me was intended to finally flesh out and help me gain at least a baseline understanding of HTML and CSS both in how it translates into a webpage and how the code is structured conceptually. Along the way I learned about github’s functionality, how a website’s files are structured and systemed, how to adapt a webpage for different screen sizes, embedding elements, and how to design and structure a website among other things. I’ve always appreciated the purple and yellow color scheme, many may associate it heavily with a violet flower blooming against a dandelion, or the sunlight beaming onto an exotic plant though the roof of a jungle.

  What I had intended with this color scheme and how I appreciate it the most, is actually a pretty underrated implementation of its complementarity. Egregiously “gaudy” and boastful people will pair finely crafted silk capes with large gold status pieces, and this is a really entertaining concept to me cosmically. This aesthetic has been adapted and packaged over and over again for what those people would consider commoners, to the point where you can find tons of halloween costumes using the color palette as a joke. So in a way it’s implemented ironically, beyond this I simply like how it looks.

  Blue and orange I believed would be a good pairing and I kept the blue, but sacrificed the orange to make the website more uniform. Blue and gold is another color scheme with its own beautiful history of regality and honor, so I had no quarrel with putting it front and center on the nav bar. I would like to mention i'm seeking no license whatsoever for this content, everything down to that adorable image of my cat bouncing is free reign for the internet now. Currently the navbar is in progress, i'm figuring out ways to impliment it but i hope the intenion shines through.
